This website was developed In order to provide proper Guidance and Guided paths to help students prepare for placements. We have got everything covered that one needs to crack a placement starting from learning basic coding languages such as C++, Java & Python. Next we have Data Structures covered with important & handpicked Questions. Along with this we have LeetCode Mostly asked Questions as well. Followed by resources to Core Subjects and Projects. Then we have the features developed with respect to the CodeForces Platform which can be useful as well. Lastly we have also have setup Chats and Notifications Section and Profile Section.
